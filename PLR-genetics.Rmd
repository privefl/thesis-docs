# Introduction to penalized regression models

---

## Multiple linear regression

We want to solve

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 G_1 + \cdots + \beta_p G_p + \gamma_1 COV_1 + \cdots + \gamma_q COV_q + \epsilon~.$$
--

Let $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p, \gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_q)$ and $X = [1; G_1; \dots;G_p; COV_1; \dots; COV_q]$, then

$$y = X \beta + \epsilon~.$$

--

This is equivalent to minimizing

$$||y - X \beta||_2^2 =  ||\epsilon||_2^2~,$$
--

whose solution is 

$$\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y~.$$

--

<br>

**What is the problem when analyzing genotype data?**

--

$$n < p$$

---

## Penalization term -- $L_2$ regularization

<br>

Instead, we can minimize

$$||y - X \beta||_2^2 + \lambda ||\beta||_2^2~,$$
--

whose solution is 

$$\beta = (X^T X + \lambda I)^{-1} X^T y~.$$

--

<br>

This is the L2-regularization ("**ridge**", Hoerl and Kennard, 1970); **it shrinks coefficients $\beta$ towards 0**.

.footnote[https://doi.org/10.1080/00401706.1970.10488634]

---

## Penalization term -- $L_1$ regularization

<br>

Instead, we can minimize

$$||y - X \beta||_2^2 + \lambda ||\beta||_1~,$$
--

which does not have any closed form but can be solved using iterative algorithms.

--

<br>

This is the L1-regularization ("**lasso**", Tibshirani, 1996); **it forces some of the coefficients to be equal to 0** and can be used as a means of variable selection, leading to sparse models.

.footnote[https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02080.x]

---

## Penalization term -- $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization

<br>

Instead, we can minimize

$$||y - X \beta||_2^2 + \lambda (\alpha ||\beta||_1 + (1 - \alpha) ||\beta||_2^2)~,$$
--

which does not have any closed form but can be solved using iterative algorithms ( $0 \le \alpha \le 1$ ).

--

<br>

This is the L1- and L2-regularization ("**elastic-net**", Zou and Hastie, 2005); it is a compromise between the two previous penalties.

.footnote[https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00503.x]

---

## Advantages and drawbacks of penalization

--

### Advantages

- Makes it possible to solve linear problems when $n < p$

- Generally prevents overfitting (because of smaller effects)

--

### Drawback

- Add at least one hyper-parameter ( $\lambda$ ) that needs to be chosen and another one if using the elastic-net regularization ( $\alpha$ )

--

### Alternative

- Select a few variables before fitting the linear model (e.g. using marginal significance/p-values); heuristic: $p = n / 10$

---

## Cross-validation for choosing hyper-parameters

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://privefl.github.io/R-presentation/crossval.png")
```

However, if using e.g. R package {glmnet}, it can take a long time to run for genetic data.

## Cross-Model Selection and Averaging (CMSA)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privefl/paper2-PRS/master/figures/simple-CMSA.png")
```

---

## Advantages of using {bigstasr}

<br>

- faster (mainly because of early-stopping criterion)

- memory efficient (because data is stored on disk)

- parallelization of fitting (easy because data on disk)

So, can be applied to huge genotype data.
