### GWAS and polygenic risk scores (PRS)

**Studying common diseases**, such as heart diseases, cancers, diabetes

<br>

Thanks to GWAS, we know that

- many **common** genetic variants are causal $\left(\beta_j \neq 0\right)$

- but, they usually have a **small effect size** $\beta_j$ on their own   
    
    $\Rightarrow$ <u>a common causal variant is not useful as a risk factor</u>

--

<br>

From GWAS data to **polygenic risk scores (PRS)**:

- variants can be aggregated in a joint predictive model: $PRS = \sum_j \hat\gamma_j~G_j$

- by aggregating many small effects, the PRS can have a large effect 

    $\Rightarrow$ the $PRS$ can be useful as a risk factor

### <u>Public Health</u>: refining risk assessment from traditional risk factors

<u>Traditional risk factors</u>: age, smoking, pollution, low SES, diet, physical inactivity, family history, (low-frequency large-effect) genetic mutations, etc

# A major limitation of PRS:

## their poor portability across populations

## risks exacerbating health disparities

### PRS performance drops with distance from training population

### Explanation: we often don't use causal variants in practice

# The solution $\Rightarrow$ my proposed project:

## identifying causal variants and using them

## in polygenic risk scores (PRS)

### Scaling methods to using 10M genetic variants (WP1)

- there are ~10M common variants

- but most PRS methods (including mine) use ~1M variants    
(mostly for computational reasons and due to redundancy)

<br>

```{r, out.width="88%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/variants_in_set.png")
```

<br>

.center[**We need to use 10M to make sure most causal variants are present**

`r icons::fontawesome("laptop")` I will optimize both methods and data structures to use 10M variants `r icons::fontawesome("laptop")`]

### Prioritizing causal variants thanks to functional annotations (WP2)

<br>

```{r, out.width="95%"}

.center[**Variants in some functional categories are more likely to be causal**

`r icons::fontawesome("laptop")` I will integrate this information into my Bayesian PRS methodology `r icons::fontawesome("laptop")`]

### Prioritizing causal variants thanks to multi-ancestry data (WP3)

### Feasability

- **I have developed many efficient & powerful methods** in past 9 years  

    - LDpred2, widely used for constructing PRS + often ranked best
    
    - bigstatsr and bigsnpr, R(cpp) packages for large-scale analyses

- I have published 28 papers with 2800 citations in total,    
including **2000 for my 11 first-author papers**

- My **funding strategy** to recruit people:

  - ANR JCJC
  
  - ATIP-Avenir

- I have **co-supervised several young researchers**

    - two PhD students who graduated (**co-last author on 4 papers**)
    
    - ongoing: two PhD students, one research assistant, one postdoc

- I have found **several collaborators** for these work packages    
(Broad, UCLA, Oxford, Helsinki, Pasteur, INRIA, etc)

### WP1: Using millions of genetic variants (possible solutions)

<br>

**The main bottleneck is storing and using the matrix of correlations between variants.**

<br>

Possible solutions:

- quantization: storing correlations with two bytes only (divide size by 4) 

- compression on top of quantization

- matrix seriation $\rightarrow$ reordering variants to make blocks smaller

- eigendecomposition

- adapt methods to use very sparse *inverse* covariance matrices

### WP4: Ensuring the quality and coverage of the training data

<br>

- there are lots of problems with the input data (GWAS summary statistics)

- which can causes lots of misspecifications and biases in the methods

- I propose to implement a QC and imputation method (synergistic)

- and to provide a set of highly refined GWAS summary statistics
