# Introduction & Motivation

### Genetic variants and GWAS

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Overview_geneticvariants_GWAS.png")
```

---

### GWAS and polygenic risk scores (PRS)

**Studying common diseases**, such as heart diseases, cancers, diabetes

<br>

Thanks to GWAS, we know that

- many **common** genetic variants are causal/pathogenic

- but, they usually have a **small effect size** $\beta_j$ on their own

- $\Rightarrow$ a single common variant *cannot* be used as a risk factor

--

<br>

From GWAS data to polygenic risk scores (PRS):

- variants can be aggregated in a joint predictive model: $PRS = \sum_j \hat\gamma_j~G_j$

- $\Rightarrow$ the $PRS$ has a much larger effect size than each $G_j$    
and *can* be used as a risk factor

### <u>Public Health</u><br>Using a PRS to refine risk assessment from traditional risk factors

# A major limitation of PRS:

## their poor portability across populations

## risks exacerbating health disparities

---

### PRS performance drops with distance from training population

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ratio-dist-4.png")
```

---

### How to explain this drop in predictive performance of PRS?

Counter-intuitive, because it has been shown that 

- **causal variants are mostly similar** across populations

- **their effect sizes are also very similar**

--

<br>

<u>The issue</u>: we often don't use causal variants in practice 

```{r, out.width="78%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/LD-multipop.png")
```

# The solution:

# precisely identifying causal variants

### An overview of my proposed project MAGNIFIC

<br>

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Overview_MAGNIFIC.png")
```

---

### Prioritizing causal variants thanks to functional annotations (WP2)

For example, protein-coding variants, regulatory variants, conserved variants (in regions with little evolutionary change)

```{r, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/anno-enrich2.png")
```

### Prioritizing causal variants thanks to multi-ancestry data (WP3)

<br>

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/multiancestry-finemapping2.png")
```

---

### WP1 and WP4 to ensure causal variants are available

<br>

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Overview_MAGNIFIC.png")
```

### Feasability

- Already **developed many state-of-the-art methods** in past 9 years  

    - LDpred2, widely used for constructing PRS
    
    - bigstatsr and bigsnpr, R(cpp) packages for large-scale analyses

- Published 28 papers with 2800 citations in total,    
including **2000 for my 11 first-author papers**

--

- **Funding Strategy:**

  - ATIP-Avenir (applied)
  
  - ANR JCJC (planned)

--

- Already have **experience supervising** 

    - two PhD students who graduated, with **4 co-last-author papers**
    
    - ongoing: two PhD students, one research assistant, one postdoc
    
--

- Already found **several collaborators** for these work packages    
(Broad, UCLA, Helsinki, Pasteur, INRIA, etc)

### Integration into INSERM Toulouse Laboratory

<br>

- **Host Team**: "GenoFun: <u>Fun</u>ctional impact of <u>Geno</u>mic variations on disease", a Bioinformatics team at IRSD, INSERM U1220

--

- **Collaboration**:

  - **Sarah Djebali (CR INSERM)**: Expert in functional genome annotation, supporting integration of annotations
  
  - **Jean Monlong (CR INSERM)**: Specialist in pangenomes and structural variants, expanding from simply using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
  
  - **Other lab members**: validation of causal variants using experimental models (e.g., mice, organoids)
  
--
  
- Technical support and computational resources via **Genotoul compute cluster** (5000 cores, 83 TB RAM, 7.5 PB storage)

--

- **Collaborative Environment**: Toulouse bioinformatics, biostatistics, mathematics and informatics network (INRAE, CNRS, INSERM, Uni)

---

### Relevance to INSERM's mission

<br>

My project aligns closely with INSERM's commitment to advancing public health through biomedical and bioinformatics innovation:

- **Precision medicine**: enabling earlier and more accurate disease risk assessment

- **Reducing health disparities**: improving risk models for all worldwide populations

- **Bridging research and clinical practice**: facilitating the integration of PRS into clinical and public health strategies

- **Enhancing genetic discoveries**: Improving the identification of causal variants to identify disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets
