# Introduction & Motivation

---

### Genetic variants and GWAS

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Overview_SNP_GWAS.png")
```

---

### Disease genetic architecture and polygenic scores

```{r, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/disease-archi.png")
```

--

- many common genetic variants contribute to the risk of common diseases

- but, they usually have a very small effect on their own

- however, aggregating many small effects can result in a very large effect

- this is called a polygenic (risk) score (PGS or PRS)

---

### <u>Public Health</u><br>Using PRS to modify risk assessment from traditional risk factors

```{r, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/PRS-risk.PNG")
```

.footnote[**In a randomized clinical trial in the UK, a PRS added to a QRISK®2 cardiovascular disease risk calculator demonstrated robust clinical acceptance and clinical utility in the primary care setting.**]

### Modification of Lifetime Breast Cancer Risk for Pathogenic Variant Carriers and Noncarriers by an 86–Single-Nucleotide Variant Score

```

# A major limitation of polygenic scores:

# their poor portability across ancestries

---

### Predictive performance drops with genetic distance to training

```{r, out.width="92%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ratio-dist-3.png")
```

---

### How to explain this drop in predictive performance?

<br>

It has been recently shown that 

- **causal variants are mostly similar** across many populations

- **their effect sizes are also very similar**

--

<br>

The issue: 

- in practice, we often don't use causal variants 

- instead, we use tagging variants,    
highly correlated with the causal variants **in the training population**

--

- but correlations between tagging and causal variants **varies across populations**
  
- which reduces the predictive power of tagging variants **in other populations**

---

# The solution:

# precisely identifying causal variants

### An overview of my proposed project MAGNIFIC

<br>

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Overview_MAGNIFIC.png")
```

---

### Feasability

- Already **developed many state-of-the-art methods** in past 9 years  

    - LDpred2, widely used for constructing polygenic scores
    - bigstatsr and bigsnpr, R packages for large-scale analyses

- Published 28 papers, including **9 as first author and 2 as sole author**    
(around 2750 citations in total, 2000 for my 11 first-author papers)

--

- Already have **experience supervising** 

    - two PhD students who graduated, with **4 co-last-author papers**
    - ongoing: two PhD students, one research assistant, one postdoc
    
--

- Already found **several collaborators** for these work packages    
(Broad, UCLA, Helsinki, Pasteur, INRIA, etc)

--

- **Funding Strategy:**
  - ATIP-Avenir (applied),
  - ANR Young Researchers Grant (planned),
  - ERC Starting Grant (planned).

### Integration into INSERM Toulouse Laboratory

<br>

- **Host Team**: "GenoFun: <u>Fun</u>ctional impact of <u>Geno</u>mic variations on disease", a Bioinformatics team at IRSD, INSERM U1220.

--

- **Collaboration**:

  - **Sarah Djebali (INSERM CR)**: Expert in functional genome annotation, supporting integration of annotations
  
  - **Jean Monlong (INSERM CR)**: Specialist in pangenomes and structural variants, expanding from simply using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
  
  - **Other lab members**: validation of causal variants using experimental models (e.g., mice, organoids)
  
--
  
- Technical support and computational resources via **Genotoul compute cluster** (5000 cores, 83 TB RAM, 7.5 PB storage).

--

- **Collaborative Environment**: Toulouse bioinformatics, biostatistics, mathematics and informatics network (INRAE, CNRS, INSERM, Uni).

---

### Relevance to INSERM's Mission

<br>

My project aligns closely with INSERM's commitment to advancing public health through biomedical innovation:

- **Precision Medicine**: earlier and more accurate disease risk prediction

- **Reducing Health Disparities**: better predictive models for all worldwide populations

- **Facilitating Research Translation**: providing more robust and actionable insights into the genetic architecture of complex diseases
