### Abstract

<br>

- developing PRS from millions of variants remain challenging

- people have used either C+T or restricted to 1M HapMap3 variants

- they present a set of algorithmic improvements and compact data structures that enable scaling PRS to use 18M variants

- especially compression of LD matrices (also good for sharing)

- incorporate these changes in their VIPRS method

- now much faster and more memory-efficient

- better prediction when using more variants?

---

### Introduction

<br>

- LD matrices are very large (e.g. 15 GB for 1M variants in LDpred2 with 3cM window; twice if not using the compact format)

- running PGS methods can take up to a few hours for 1M variants

- they propose to

    - quantize and compress LD matrices (size /50)
    
    - assess the spectral properties of different LD matrices
    
    - optimize VIPRS to use the compressed LD matrices
    
    - use two layers of parallelism in VIPRS
    
---

### Efficient LD matrices (methods)

<br>

- two types: either banded (windowed) or block-diagonal (LD blocks)

- can reduce size by

    - storing the upper triangle only (/2)
    
    - storing correlations with less bytes    
    ($r^\text{q} = round(r \cdot s)$ and $r^\text{dq} = r^\text{q} / s$ with $s = 127$ or $s = 32767$) 
    
    ```{r, out.width = "85%"}
    knitr::include_graphics("figures/JC-VIPRS2-table1.png")
    ```
    
    - storing in compressed chunks (*Zarr* format, also cloud-native) 

---

### Efficient LD matrices (results)

<br>

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/JC-VIPRS2-fig2a.png")
```

---

### Optimizations in VIPRS

<br>

- now use C++ instead of Python (speed x10)

- now use optimized matrix operations    
(not sure exactly where, since they use coordinate ascent)

- use 32-bit floats instead of 64-bit doubles for parameters (speed x2!?)

- accommodate the new triangular format for LD + quantized versions

- parallelize over chromosomes (but more memory needed)

- parallelize the coordinate ascent (difficult)

- don't parallelize over LD blocks?    
(want to also accommodate windowed LD)

---

### Investigating numerical instabilities

<br>

- LD is often not positive semi-definite (PSD), i.e. min(eigval) is negative

- the larger are the negative eigenvalues, the more numerical instabilities there are

- three main contributing factors that can impact the spectrum of estimated LD matrices: 

    - sparsification pattern (e.g. windowed, but not LD blocks), 
    
    - pairwise correlation estimator in the presence of missing data    
    (use mean imputation or imputed data instead),
    
    - approximation error (e.g. thresholding or quantization).

--

<br>

- their solution: use $\tilde{R} - \min(0, \lambda_\text{min}) I$ instead of $\tilde{R}$    
(actually they test {0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2} * $\lambda_\text{min}$)
    
---

### Minimum eigenvalues for block-diagonal LD

<br>

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/JC-VIPRS2-figS8b.png")
```

.footnote[MI: mean imputation before computing LD    
(instead of using pairwise complete observations)]

---

### Minimum eigenvalues for windowed LD

<br>

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/JC-VIPRS2-figS7a.png")
```

.footnote[LRLD: long-range LD regions (e.g. HLA)]

### Numbers of samples and variants

<br>

```{r, out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/JC-VIPRS2-table2.png")
```

--

<br>

Sets of variants considered:

- 18M variants with INFO > 0.8 and MAC > 20 (in the whole cohort `r ICON_TRI_EXCL`)

- 13M variants with additionally MAF > 0.1%

- HapMap3+ (1.4M)

---

### Predictive performance

<br>

```{r, out.width = "100%"}

```

### My thoughts on this paper

What I liked:

- They used many axes of optimization, for both speed and memory

- They looked at different LD matrices and their spectral properties

--

<br>

What I didn't like or didn't understand:

- Runtime results are too-good-to-be-true? e.g. it takes one minute to fit VIPRS on 1.1M variants (uncompressing should take more time)

- I think int8-quantization is too much, but int16 takes 4x more space (because of less efficient compression I guess)

- using more variants may not be beneficial    
when cannot distinguish between correlated variants    
(need e.g. functional annotations and multi-ancestry)

- LD blocks are imperfect, especially for large set of variants

- using one triangle is more difficult for nothing? (compression)
