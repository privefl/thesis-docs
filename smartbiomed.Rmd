### History

<br>

- Background in **Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics**

- PhD defended in September 2019 (Grenoble, France)

- At **NCRR, Aarhus University** since May 2019,    
part of **Prof. Bjarni Vilhjálmsson's group**:
  
    - as a visiting PhD student for 3 months
    
    - started as a postdoc in October 2019
    
    - promoted to senior researcher in January 2022
    
    - help Bjarni co-supervise some people from the group    
    with my expertise in data analysis and method/software development
    
    - hired by SMARTbiomed starting in August

### Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)

<br>

For **common complex diseases** such as heart diseases, cancers, diabetes,

- many **common genetic variants** are causal, but with a small effect    
(they have some small impact on the disease probability)
    
    $\Rightarrow$ a common causal variant is not useful as a standalone risk factor

--

<br>

In contrast to rare mutations causing rare monogenic diseases

--

<br>

With **polygenic risk scores (PRS)**,

- many genetic variants are aggregated in a joint predictive model

- by aggregating many small effects, the PRS can have a large effect 

    $\Rightarrow$ the PRS is useful as a risk factor

---

### Public Health: refining risk assessment from traditional risk factors

<u>Traditional risk factors</u>: age, smoking, pollution, low SES, diet, physical inactivity, family history, (low-frequency large-effect) genetic mutations, etc

### My main research focus

<center><h3>Improving PRS methods</h3></center>

<br>

**Interdisciplinary** research focused on **method development**:

- **Mathematics/Statistics**: statistical models

- **Computer Science**: highly optimized and reliable software

- **Machine Learning**: predictive models

- **Biology/Health** applications

---

### My contributions

My scientific publications:

- 11 first-author papers, mainly on methods and their implementation

    $\Rightarrow$ very efficient & competitive methods, widely used and cited (2000+)

- 4 co-senior-author papers on methods    
(from two PhD students co-supervised with Bjarni)

--

Most known for

- LDpred2, a polygenic score method that is widely used and competitive

- bigstastr and bigsnpr, R/C++ packages for analyzing very large genetic/omic datasets

--

Also teaching the next generation of scientists:

- an advanced R course for PhD students (8 years in a row)

- the Statistical Genetics SMARTbiomed Summer school next week

---

### My role in SMARTbiomed

<br>

- bring some expertise in data analysis and method/software development

- train the next generation of scientists    
in Statistical Genetics, data analysis, and software development (R/C++)

- co-supervisor/mentor for Ole, Lianyun, and others

- continue providing useful tools for the Statistical Genetics community

---

### What I am working on (currently or planned)

<br>

- ancestry deconvolution method

    - to better estimate the ancestry composition of genetic data

--

- quality control and imputation of GWAS summary statistics

    - to avoid biased results and false positives, and increase data coverage

--

- reduce the size of currently used data structures

    - to facilitate use and sharing of the data

--

- integrate functional annotations and multi-ancestry data to LDpred2

    - to identify causal genetic variants    
    (to understand disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets)
    
    - to improve polygenic scores for all ancestries
    (to improve disease risk stratification in clinical settings)
