# Main objective

---

## Compute Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) 

### in order to identify high risk individuals

```{r, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/PRS.png")
```

---

## 4 main difficulties

<br>

- Size of the data (dozens to hundreds of GB)

- Hundreds of thousands of correlated variables (variables with overlapping information)

- Generalization of models on different populations

- Integration of non-genetic data in the models

---

# Big Data

### Simpler solutions are easier to implement

---

## What I want to be able to do

### Data analysis on large-scale genotype matrices!

- Be fast to test many ideas quickly

    - code should be fast
    - I shouldn't have to make many conversions
    - it should be easily to combine multiple functions
    
- Not be restricted in my analysis
   
    - Basically use all I already know in R
    
- Work on my computer

    - I have 64 GB of RAM and 12 cores
    - Working on a server is not as easy as on my computer

<br><center>**Smooth and fast analysis!**

<!-- ## Memory solution when working in R -->

## Two R packages: bigstatsr and bigsnpr

### Statistical tools with big matrices stored on disk

<br>

- **bigstatsr** for many types of matrix, to be used by any field of research

- **bigsnpr** for functions that are specific to the analysis of genetic data

<br>

```{r, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bigsnpr-submitted.png")
```

---

## Comparative performance

### Computing partial SVD

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/benchmark-pca.png")
```

---

class: center, middle, inverse

# Ongoing paper

### Comparison of methods for computing PRS

#### (will be submitted by the end of April)

---

## Recall of what we want to achieve

### Predict a phenotype: pitfalls of the widely-used model

- Weights learned independently

- Correlation is taken care of heuristically

- Regularization is taken care of heuristically

### A better solution?

We can use **statistical learning methods**.

For example, we can use logistic regression on all variables at once by using a clever implementation.

# Future work

### UK Biobank

---

## UK Biobank

It is an extremely large dataset with 

 - genetic data
 
 - clinical data
 
 - environmental data

## Prospects

- [Paper 3, before the end of 2018] training in one population to improve training and prediction in another population

- [Paper 4, in 2019, while writing the thesis] assess how can we combine the information provided by genetic data with clinical and environmental data, possibly in a non-linear way

- find a job in Machine Learning in some company
