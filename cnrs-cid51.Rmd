### Genetic variants and GWAS

### GWAS and polygenic risk scores (PRS)

**Studying common diseases**, such as heart diseases, cancers, diabetes

<br>

Thanks to GWAS, we know that

- many **common** genetic variants are causal $\left(\beta_j \neq 0\right)$

- but, they usually have a **small effect size** $\beta_j$ on their own   
    
    $\Rightarrow$ <u>a common causal variant is not useful as a risk factor</u>

--

<br>

From GWAS data to **polygenic risk scores (PRS)**:

- variants can be aggregated in a joint predictive model: $PRS = \sum_j \hat\gamma_j~G_j$

- by aggregating many small effects, the PRS can have a large effect 

    $\Rightarrow$ the $PRS$ can be useful as a risk factor

---

### Public Health: refining risk assessment from traditional risk factors

<u>Traditional risk factors</u>: age, smoking, pollution, low SES, diet, physical inactivity, family history, (low-frequency large-effect) genetic mutations, etc

# Some of my previous work

### Developing PRS methods (1/3)

<br>

**F. Privé**, H. Aschard, & M.G.B. Blum (2019). "Efficient implementation of penalized regression for genetic risk prediction." *Genetics*.

<br>

- **based on individual-level data** (genotypes and phenotype)

- **faster and on-disk** implementation of penalized regressions (> glmnet)

- **alternative to cross-validation** to choose hyper-parameters    
    $\rightarrow$ avoids refitting and allows for early-stopping criterion

---

### Developing PRS methods (2/3)

<br>

**F. Privé**, B.J. Vilhjálmsson, H. Aschard, & M.G.B. Blum (2019). "Making the most of Clumping and Thresholding for polygenic scores." *The American Journal of Human Genetics*.

<br>

- **based on GWAS summary statistics** (effect sizes and p-values)

- reimplemented an existing widely-used PRS method 

- efficiently investigated **5600 combinations of four hyper-parameters**    
(only one hyper-parameter was considered usually)

- further improved predictive performance with **stacking**

---

### Developing PRS methods (3/3)

<br>

**F. Privé**, J. Arbel, & B.J. Vilhjálmsson (2020). "LDpred2: better, faster, stronger." *Bioinformatics*.

<br>

- Bayesian PRS model, based on GWAS summary statistics

- **faster and more robust** to numerical issues than LDpred

- developed an on-disk sparse matrix format for more efficient parallelism

- two new versions:

    - **a 'sparse' option**, which truly fits some effects to zero
    
    - **an 'auto' option**, which can infer the two hyper-parameters
    
- **post-hoc quality control** of Gibbs sampler chains

---

### Robustness of PRS models using GWAS summary statistics

A joint model from summary statistics: $$\hat\beta = (\underbrace{X^T X}_\text{covariance})^{-1} \underbrace{X^T y}_\text{GWAS effect sizes}$$

- In practice, we use $(G_2^T G_2)^{-1} G_1^T y_1$ (misspecification: $G_2 \neq G_1$)

- Another issue comes from using GWAS meta-analyses (errors, $\neq$ N's)

<br>

--

- **F. Privé** (2022). "Optimal linkage disequilibrium splitting." *Bioinformatics*.

    $\rightarrow$ using **dynamic programming to identify a block-diagonal structure** in the covariance/correlation matrix  
    $\rightarrow$ to **improve the robustness and speed** of PRS methods like LDpred2

# A major limitation of PRS:

## their poor portability across populations

## risks exacerbating health disparities

### PRS performance drops with distance from training population

### Scaling methods to using 10M genetic variants (WP1)

- there are ~10M common variants

- but most PRS methods (including mine) use ~1M variants    
(mostly for computational reasons and due to redundancy)

.small2[<br>]

```{r, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/variants_in_set.png")
```

.center[**We need to use 10M to make sure most causal variants are present**

<br>

`r icons::fontawesome("laptop")` I will optimize both methods and data structures to use 10M variants `r icons::fontawesome("laptop")`

(using quantization + compression, or sparse inverse covariance matrices)]

### Prioritizing causal variants thanks to functional annotations (WP2)

<br>

`r icons::fontawesome("laptop")` I will integrate this information into my Bayesian PRS methodology `r icons::fontawesome("laptop")`

(to update non-informative prior probabilities of being causal)]

### Prioritizing causal variants thanks to multi-ancestry data (WP3)

### Feasability

- **I have developed many efficient & competitive methods** 

    - LDpred2, widely used for constructing PRS + often ranked best
    
    - bigstatsr and bigsnpr, R(cpp) packages for large-scale analyses

- My methods are used and cited a lot (2000+)

- My **funding strategy** to recruit people:

  - ANR JCJC
  
  - local fundings (MIAI, university, region)

- I have **co-supervised several young researchers**

    - two PhD students who graduated (**co-last author on 4 papers**)
    
    - ongoing: two PhD students, one research assistant, one postdoc

- I have found **several collaborators** for these work packages    
(Broad, UCLA, Oxford, Helsinki, Pasteur, INRIA, etc)

### WP1: Using millions of genetic variants (possible solutions)

<br>

**The main bottleneck is storing and using the matrix of covariances/correlations between variants.**

<br>

Possible solutions:

- quantization: storing correlations with two bytes only (divide size by 4) 

- compression on top of quantization

- matrix seriation $\rightarrow$ reordering variants to make blocks smaller

- eigendecomposition

- adapt methods to use very sparse *inverse* covariance matrices

### WP4: Ensuring the quality and coverage of the training data

- there are lots of problems with the input data (GWAS summary statistics)

- which can causes lots of misspecifications and biases in the methods
