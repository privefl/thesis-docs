## Open Science

<br>

> - Open science refers to the unhindered dissemination of results, methods and products from scientific research. 
> - It draws on the opportunity provided by recent digital progress to develop open access to publications and – as much as possible – data, source code and research methods. 
> - It is a means for publicly funded research projects to retain control over the results they produce. 
> - It builds an ecosystem in which science becomes better substantiated and more transparent, reproducible, effective and cumulative. 
> - It aims to democratize access to knowledge, which is useful for teaching and training, and for the economy, public policy, citizens and society as a whole. 
> - Finally, it constitutes a lever for scientific integrity and builds citizen trust in science.

### Research from public fundings has to be open-access

<br>

...usually within six months of publication

<br>

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/scholar-open.jpg")
```

---

### High costs of open-access publication

```{r, out.width="55%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F5z3E3RXMAAlhpk?format=jpg&name=small")
```

Nature: 9,750 EUR – Nature Neuroscience: 9,750 EUR – <br>Nature Communications: 5,190 EUR – Bioinformatics: 2,600 EUR – <br>AJHG: 4,600 EUR (but 0 if you are willing to wait for six months)

---

### New publishing solutions are arising

<br>

E.g. [COMPUTO](https://computo.sfds.asso.fr/), a journal of the French Statistical Society

<br>

**Computo is free for both readers and authors.**

<br>

Computo has been created in the context of a reproducibility crisis in science, which calls for higher standards in the publication of scientific results.    
Computo aims at promoting computational/algorithmic contributions in statistics and machine learning that provide insight into which models or methods are the most appropriate to address a specific scientific question.

---

### Before publication: preprint

<br>

Put your preprints out there: bioRxiv, medRxiv, PsyArXiv

--

<br>

An additional benefit:

> Releasing a preprint is associated with more attention and citations for the peer-reviewed article
>
> – https://elifesciences.org/articles/52646

---

### Sharing your analysis code

Reproducibility is still a problem, and not much has changed.

The Methods section is not enough for reproducing some analysis; an example:

<center>
<iframe width="700" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ct-lOOUqmyY?si=ApMwDlDLmtJ1RP_E&amp;start=5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-external="1"></iframe>

## FAIR principles for data

[reused from [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/module-open-science-dm-practices/02-fair/index.html)]

<br>

To try to guide the scientific community on how to ensure that the research data is useful for others in the digital age, [the FAIR principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) were published in 2016.

"To be useful for others data should be FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ... for both Machines and Humans"

***

So what does this mean? A brief condensed summary:

--

#### Findable

- Data have a globally unique persistent identifier
    - e.g. a DOI, database accession number, etc
- Data are described by metadata
    - Information that explains the data
- Data and metadata are findable in a search resource
    - There must be ways of searching for the data

---

#### Accessible

- Data is retrievable through a standardised communication protocol (open, free, allowing authentication & authorisation where necessary)
    - e.g. http, sftp, etc
- Metadata are accessible, even if data is no longer available
    - Information about the data can be found even if data is no longer available

--
<br>

#### Interoperable

- Metadata use a formal, accessible, shared language for knowledge representation
    - Metadata is available in a form that even a computer can make use of
- Metadata use vocabularies that follow the FAIR principles
    - Standardised ways of capturing information about the data, that in themselves is FAIR
- Metadata include qualified references to other metadata
    - If the data relies on other data, there must be links to those

---

#### Reusable

- Data have a clear data usage license
    - It is obvious under what conditions the data can be reused
- Metadata are associated with detailed provenance
    - The metadata is detailed enough to understand for what research questions it is relevant to reuse
- Metadata meet domain-relevant community standards
    - Metadata is described according to existing standards in the research field

<br>

<br>

A couple of things to note about FAIR:

- Both humans and machines are intended users of data
- The principles are not necessarily about open data
    - "As open as possible, as closed as necessary"
- FAIRness is not something absolute
    - Different levels of FAIR maturity
- FAIR does not force any particular technical standards

---

### "Data available on reasonable request"

...only 7% of the time (cf. [this study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2022.05.019))

```{r, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S089543562200141X-gr2_lrg.jpg")
```

---

### My current practices

<br>

- I mostly use the UK Biobank data, which is broadly used and available to any researcher that applies for it

- All my statistical methods have their code open sourced on GitHub (usually as R packages)

- I always share the analysis code of papers on GitHub
    - when accessing data from the internet, I always try to have some code doing the download, rather than manually doing it, e.g. with `runonce::download_file()` in R
    - use relative paths instead of absolute paths
    - people should be able to see when you make some changes to your code (e.g. from the Git history)

- Key results are shared via GitHub or FigShare

- Specific results such as GWAS summary statistics and PGS effect sizes are shared through dedicated databases such as the GWAS and PGS Catalogs
