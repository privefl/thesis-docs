### Imputed data on GenomeDK

<br>

- comes from imputation using the RICOPILI pipeline

- imputation has been performed **separately** for the previous (2012) data and the new (2015) data 

- outputs in IMPUTE2 Oxford format storing imputation probabilities (to be 0, 1, or 2)

- qc1: with an INFO score > 0.1 and MAF > 0.005

---

### Imputed data in my format

<br>

- R object to access genotype data stored in a binary file, with matrix-like accessors

- This stores dosage data (rounded to 2 decimal places)    
P(0) = 0.5, P(1) = 0.3, P(2) = 0.2 -> dosage = 0.7 (between 0 and 2) 

- I merged the two datasets, for variants passing qc on both    
-> almost 134K individuals and 8.8M variants    
-> one big file (1.1 TB), but can easily access only a subset in R and C++

---

### Preparing data for Denmark Statistics

<br>

- I splitted the dosage data into 137 parts with at most 70K variants

- I wrote these to text files

- Then Sussie converted these as SAS file to be sent to DST

- Also two files with information on variants and individuals

- Also 4 parts for chromosome X

---

### What needs to be done on DST

<br>

- Emil is helping me convert these 137 SAS files back to my format

- **We are missing files, especially information on the variants**

- This might take one week, depending on how easily we can parallelize this

- Then you can either use my R packages to analyze the data,    
or write bed files (possible loss of information)

### What can be done with the packages

```{r, out.width="92%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/summary-table.JPG")
```
