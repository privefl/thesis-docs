# Agile Research

## How to work efficiently, especially remotely 

<br>

### Florian Privé

#### WIP -- 02/10/20

## About me

<br>

- Graduated in Informatics and Applied Mathematics 

- PhD in predictive human genetics

- Just started my second year as a postdoc at NCRR

- Now have the perspective from both first author and (co-)last author


---

## Agile workflow

<br>

- Primarily developed for software development

- A response to the problem of many teams failing to deliver a working product in time, and funders pulling money because they lost confidence or/and interest in the project

---

## Agile workflow in Research?

<br>

A crude analogy:

--

- the team: the first author(s)

--

- the final product: the paper

--

- a working component of the product: a figure or table of the paper

--

- stackholders/funders: the last author(s)
